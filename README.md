# reciepebook
use Node.js to build a RESTful API, integrate with a third-party API, and implement user authentication and authorization that allows users to search and save their favorite recipes. Here are the basic features of the project:

1. Users can create an account and log in to access their saved recipes.

2. Users can search for recipes by ingredient, cuisine, or meal type.

3. The API should use a third-party API (such as Spoonacular) to fetch recipe information, including ingredients and cooking instructions.

4. Users can save their favorite recipes to their account.

5. Users can edit or delete their saved recipes.

6. The API should include authentication and authorization to ensure that only authenticated users can access their saved recipes.

Additionally,  a simple front-end interface (using  React ) to demonstrate how the API can be used by clients.
